# Adapter Pattern

The **Adapter Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two interfaces, enabling classes to collaborate that otherwise couldn't due to interface differences.

## Pattern Type

- **Type:** Structural

## Purpose

The Adapter Pattern is used to:
- Integrate classes with different interfaces.
- Reuse existing code without modifying it.
- Promote flexibility and reusability in codebases.

## How It Works

An adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface, allowing clients to interact with the class using the expected interface.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a code example in **Kotlin** demonstrating the Adapter Pattern. You will find:
- A real-world scenario where the Adapter Pattern is useful.
- Kotlin implementation of the pattern.
- Test cases to validate the implementation.
