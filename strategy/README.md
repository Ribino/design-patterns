# Strategy Design Pattern - Behavioral Patterns

This project demonstrates the **Strategy** design pattern, a behavioral pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. The pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

## Key Concepts

- **Encapsulation of algorithms:** Each strategy is implemented as a separate class with a common interface.
- **Interchangeability:** Strategies can be swapped without modifying the context.
- **Open/Closed Principle:** New strategies can be added without changing existing code.

## Usage

This repository contains example implementations and usage scenarios for the Strategy pattern.
